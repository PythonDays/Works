<!--    Create an HTML landing page
    Utilize the advanced HTML elements

You’ll need to do the following:

    Design a header for your landing page. This should include an image and text that clearly tell visitors what they can find on the site.
    Create an introduction to your site, which should provide details about the purpose and mission of your site. Include some information about yourself and why you’ve created it in this section as well.
    Design an About Me section that includes more detailed information about yourself and why you created this website. This should include links to other websites where people can find out more about you if they’d like additional information (such as LinkedIn).
    Write out at least two paragraphs of text explaining what each section of your site contains (for example, if there’s a blog or news feed on the site). You don’t need to write out every single piece of content—just enough so that someone visiting the site gets an idea of what it looks like without having to click around too much first!
    Write a blog post about your journey to become a web developer! Summarize what you’ve learned so far, and what you’ve found most interesting.
    A call-to-action button that encourages visitors to sign up for something (like an email newsletter) or make a purchase-->
